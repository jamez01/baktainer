2. Fix HIGH priority bugs and reliability issues
3. Add testing infrastructure before making architectural changes
4. Implement MEDIUM priority improvements incrementally
5. Consider LOW priority enhancements based on user feedback

For each TODO item, create a separate branch, implement the fix, add tests, and ensure all existing functionality continues to work before merging.
