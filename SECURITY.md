# Security Considerations for Baktainer

This document outlines important security considerations when deploying and using Baktainer.

## Docker Socket Access

### Security Implications

Baktainer requires access to the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) to discover containers and execute backup commands. This access level has significant security implications:

#### High Privileges
- **Root-equivalent access**: Access to the Docker socket grants root-equivalent privileges on the host system
- **Container escape**: A compromised Baktainer container could potentially escape to the host system
- **Full Docker control**: Can create, modify, or delete any containers on the host

#### Attack Vectors
- **Privilege escalation**: If Baktainer is compromised, attackers gain full Docker daemon access
- **Container manipulation**: Malicious actors could modify or destroy other containers
- **Host filesystem access**: Potential to mount host directories and access sensitive files

### Security Mitigations

#### 1. Docker Socket Proxy (Recommended)
Use a Docker socket proxy to limit API access:

```yaml
services:
  docker-socket-proxy:
    image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest
    environment:
      CONTAINERS: 1
      POST: 0
      BUILD: 0
      COMMIT: 0
      CONFIGS: 0
      DISTRIBUTION: 0
      EXEC: 1  # Required for backup commands
      IMAGES: 0
      INFO: 0
      NETWORKS: 0
      NODES: 0
      PLUGINS: 0
      SERVICES: 0
      SESSION: 0
      SWARM: 0
      SYSTEM: 0
      TASKS: 0
      VOLUMES: 0
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    ports:
      - "2375:2375"

  baktainer:
    image: jamez001/baktainer:latest
    environment:
      - BT_DOCKER_URL=tcp://docker-socket-proxy:2375
    depends_on:
      - docker-socket-proxy
```

#### 2. Least Privilege Principles
- Run Baktainer with minimal required permissions
- Use dedicated backup user accounts in containers
- Limit network access where possible

#### 3. Container Isolation
- Deploy in isolated networks
- Use resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Monitor container behavior for anomalies

#### 4. Alternative Architectures
Consider these alternatives for enhanced security:

##### Agent-Based Approach
- Deploy backup agents inside each database container
- Use message queues for coordination
- Eliminates need for Docker socket access

##### Kubernetes Native
- Use Kubernetes CronJobs for scheduled backups
- Leverage RBAC for fine-grained permissions
- Use service accounts instead of Docker socket

## Database Credential Security

### Current Implementation
Database credentials are stored in Docker labels, which has security implications:

#### Risks
- **Plain text storage**: Credentials visible in container metadata
- **Process visibility**: Credentials may appear in process lists
- **Log exposure**: Risk of credential leakage in logs

### Recommended Improvements

#### 1. Docker Secrets (Swarm Mode)
```yaml
secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true

services:
  app:
    image: postgres:17
    secrets:
      - db_password
    labels:
      - baktainer.backup=true
      - baktainer.db.engine=postgres
      - baktainer.db.password_file=/run/secrets/db_password
```

#### 2. External Secret Management
- HashiCorp Vault integration
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- Kubernetes Secrets

#### 3. Environment File Encryption
- Use tools like `sops` or `age` for encrypted environment files
- Decrypt secrets at runtime only

## SSL/TLS Configuration

### Certificate Security
When using SSL/TLS for Docker API connections:

#### Best Practices
- Use proper certificate authorities
- Implement certificate rotation
- Validate certificate chains
- Monitor certificate expiration

#### Configuration
```bash
# Generate proper certificates
openssl genrsa -out ca-key.pem 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca-key.pem -sha256 -out ca.pem

# Set secure file permissions
chmod 400 ca-key.pem
chmod 444 ca.pem
```

## Network Security

### Docker Network Isolation
Create dedicated networks for backup operations:

```yaml
networks:
  backup-network:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true

services:
  baktainer:
    networks:
      - backup-network
      - default
```

### Firewall Configuration
- Restrict Docker daemon port access (2376/tcp)
- Use VPN or private networks for remote access
- Implement network segmentation

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Monitoring
Implement monitoring for:
- Unusual container creation/deletion patterns
- Backup failures or anomalies
- Network traffic anomalies
- Resource usage spikes

### Audit Logging
Enable comprehensive logging:
```yaml
environment:
  - BT_LOG_LEVEL=info
  # Consider 'debug' for security investigations
```

### File Integrity Monitoring
- Monitor backup files for unauthorized changes
- Implement checksums for backup verification
- Use immutable storage when possible

## Backup File Security

### Storage Security
- Encrypt backups at rest
- Use secure storage locations
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backup integrity verification

### Retention Policies
- Implement secure deletion for expired backups
- Use encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Consider compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate compromised containers
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope of potential compromise
3. **Recovery**: Restore from known-good backups
4. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and audit trails
5. **Improvement**: Update security measures based on findings

### Backup Verification
- Regularly test backup restoration procedures
- Verify backup integrity using checksums
- Implement automated backup validation

## Deployment Recommendations

### Production Environment
- Use container image scanning
- Implement runtime security monitoring
- Regular security updates and patching
- Network monitoring and intrusion detection

### Development Environment
- Use separate credentials from production
- Implement proper secret management
- Regular security testing and vulnerability assessments

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- Understand data residency requirements
- Implement proper encryption standards
- Maintain audit trails for compliance
- Regular compliance assessments

### Industry Standards
- Follow container security best practices (CIS Benchmarks)
- Implement security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)
- Regular penetration testing
- Security awareness training

## Security Updates

### Keeping Current
- Subscribe to security advisories
- Regular dependency updates
- Monitor CVE databases
- Implement automated security scanning

### Patch Management
- Test security updates in staging environments
- Implement rolling updates for minimal downtime
- Maintain rollback procedures
- Document security update procedures
